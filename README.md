# Diagnose-the-Fault-of-a-rotor-bearing-system-using-machine-learning-
In the fields of science and engineering, classification of faults in rotary machines using machine learning is gaining popularity. A common mistake in rotating machinery is misalignment. In order to identify misalignments in rotary machines under various circumstances, this project suggests a method

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can diagnose faults in rotor-bearing systems. A rotor-bearing system is a mechanical system that includes a rotor (a rotating component) and one or more bearings (components that support the rotor and allow it to rotate smoothly).

Faults in rotor-bearing systems can lead to significant problems, including increased vibration, reduced performance, and in extreme cases, complete failure of the system. Early detection and diagnosis of these faults is essential for ensuring safe and reliable operation of the system.

The machine learning model developed in this project will be trained on data collected from sensors and other monitoring equipment installed in the rotor-bearing system. The model will be able to analyze this data and identify patterns that are indicative of different types of faults.

The project will involve the following steps:

Data collection: Collect data from sensors and other monitoring equipment installed in the rotor-bearing system.

Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for machine learning analysis.

Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from the data that are indicative of different types of faults.

Model development: Develop a machine learning model that can diagnose faults in the rotor-bearing system based on the extracted features.

Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Deployment: Deploy the model in a real-world setting and test its performance.
