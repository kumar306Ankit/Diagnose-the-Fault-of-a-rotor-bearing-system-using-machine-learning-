# Diagnose-the-Fault-of-a-rotor-bearing-system-using-machine-learning-
In the fields of science and engineering, classification of faults in rotary machines using machine learning is gaining popularity. A common mistake in rotating machinery is misalignment. In order to identify misalignments in rotary machines under various circumstances, this project suggests a method
